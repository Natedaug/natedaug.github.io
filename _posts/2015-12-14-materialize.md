Ever since google came out with their manifesto [material design](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html#), nerds everywhere have been trying to put the design concepts into practice.

There are a number of css frameworks being built that utilize this style so any Billy off the street can design the google way.  [Matrialize](http://materializecss.com/) is one such framework. It's come a long ways since I looked at it four or five months ago.  It feels like a full framework with a number of modern looking components that [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) or even [bootstrap 4](http://blog.getbootstrap.com/2015/08/19/bootstrap-4-alpha/) doesn't have.

It's not quite as robust as bootstrap but it looks like fun to use.  So that's what I'll play with in the future to update this sites look.  If you don't want to give up your trusty bootstrap you can try the [bootstrap material theme](http://fezvrasta.github.io/bootstrap-material-design/) by [Fez Vrasta](https://github.com/FezVrasta).

Also google came out with their own called [Material Design Lite](http://www.getmdl.io/).  I haven't looked much into it yet, but if you want the design straight from the designers mouth, that would be the place to go. This is a decent article comparing it with bootstrap aptly titled [Comparing Bootstrap With Google's New Material Design Lite](http://tutorialzine.com/2015/07/comparing-bootstrap-with-mdl/) from what looks like another great resource [tutorialzine](http://tutorialzine.com/).
