## A guide using jQuery

Here's a nice easy tutorial to [Create Floating Back to Top Button with jQuery](http://html-tuts.com/back-to-top-button-jquery/). Nice to have for any site that has any considerable amount of scrolling.

[html tuts](http://html-tuts.com/) seems like a good site for tutorials.
