I've been _trying_ to use [jHipster](https://jhipster.github.io/), a [yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) generator, to scaffold out an app that uses Java in the back and angular in the front. It's more of the Mullet of generators.  I think they need to rebrand it and get rid of the hipster mascot, both mullet and hipster styles are obnoxious but at least a mullet's pretty funny looking.

Anyways, I'm as successful at finding tutorials on how to get started with [jHipster](https://jhipster.github.io/) as this guy is at getting dates.

Luckily I came across [jhipster book](http://www.jhipster-book.com/), where  [Matt Raible](http://www.infoq.com/author/Matt-Raible) walks you through making an app.  So far it's been pretty enlightening.
