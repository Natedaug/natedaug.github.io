Went though a tutorial by Christopher Buecheler called [THE DEAD-SIMPLE STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE FOR FRONT-END DEVELOPERS TO GETTING UP AND RUNNING WITH NODE.JS, EXPRESS, JADE, AND MONGODB](http://cwbuecheler.com/web/tutorials/2013/node-express-mongo/).  One thing, if you follow the tutorial, when your changing the package.json file use "mongodb": "~1.4" instead of what he uses or you will get some error.  Other than that i found it quick and easy break down of using express and mongo together.

I'm still new to sass and don't know a whole lot about it yet but the great thing is you don't have to.  You can just write normal css and then you can start throwing in some variables and nested css styling.  I've been trying to get a handle on jekyll lately and since it has to compile anyways it works well with SASS.  I used this blog to help get an understand using SASS with Jekyll by Dave Poon called [Setting up Sass/SCSS with Jekyll](http://blog.davepoon.net/2015/01/19/setting-up-sass-with-jekyll/)
