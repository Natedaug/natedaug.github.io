This is a good article in trying to break down the beginners hurdles when starting to use jekyll by Sam Bonney, called [5 common Jekyll traps for beginners (and help to overcome them!)](http://cloudcannon.com/jekyll/2015/03/13/5-common-jekyll-traps.html)

It's linked in the above blog post but I particulary enjoyed Andrew Munsell's tutorial [Building a Website with Jekyll](https://www.andrewmunsell.com/lesson/building-a-website-with-jekyll/). He starts you off with a empy project folder and has you step by step set up each directory then run jekyll build.  _Maybe it's just me, but for me,_ it was a good way to understand how the setup works. If you have [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) installed already you can jump right in, but in the _config.yml change the markdown to `markdown: kramdown` and delete the line `pygments: true` unless you already have those installed.  You don't need them.
