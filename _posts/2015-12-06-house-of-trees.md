Since this blog is mainly just a collection of resources I've been using to learn Web/Software development, I thought it would be remiss if I didn't make a post about [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/).  I'm normally scouring for free resources, but It's a paid rescource and it's worth every penny my buddy Dave pays for it.

I'm at their site on a nearly daily basis.  It has an incredibly wide berth of different languages to learn.  In the last week I've been spending time with [Andrew Chalkley](https://twitter.com/chalkers
) learning **Database Foundations** and brushing up on MySQL (He has great courses on Javascript and JQuery), also taking a course on **Express Basics** with [Huston Hedinger](https://twitter.com/hstnhdngr), and **Build a Blog with Jekyll and GitHub Pages** with the CSS guru [Guil Hernandez](https://twitter.com/guilh)(He has great courses on CSS, _when in doubt ask your self WWGD_).
