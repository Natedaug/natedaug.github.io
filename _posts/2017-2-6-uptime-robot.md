 \*beep\* \*beep\* \*boop\* \*boop\* I am a robot. I just recently started using [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/) to inform me if one of my sites goes down. When things go nuclear this helps me stay ahead of the disaster and allows me to rectify the problem or hide in my bomb shelter. 

There are many other similar choices to use. If you feel so inclined you could read [Jerry Low](https://www.webhostingsecretrevealed.net/author/jerry-low/)'s blog post [The Ultimate Guide in Tracking Website Uptime](https://www.webhostingsecretrevealed.net/blog/web-hosting-guides/the-ultimate-guide-in-tracking-website-uptime/). Almost all the ones he lists have a free teir. I like my women like I like my web tools, cheap and robotic. Sorry. On that note I will go out on bottom. \*beep\* \*beep\* \*boop\* \*boop\* That is all.
