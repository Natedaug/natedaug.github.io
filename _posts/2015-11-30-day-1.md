It's the last day of NOV. I'm setting up my first blog following a [guide](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) by Barry Clark and the fine folks over at smashing magazine.

I'm a man of few words, but I'll try and post links to resources that I find useful or interesting.  I am always trying to learn more about this crazy world we call computer and the web.  Lately I've been looking into static site generators, SASS, learning node.js and making MEAN apps.
