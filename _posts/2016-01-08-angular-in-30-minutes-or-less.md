Here is a nice angular tutorial that will help get you aquainted with it's capabilities. It's called [AngularJS Tutorial: Learn AngularJS in 30 minutes](http://www.revillweb.com/tutorials/angularjs-in-30-minutes-angularjs-tutorial/).  It's a little dated and uses Angular 1.3.4, but it's still good and he provides you with a link to the right version to use along with the tutorial.  It may take a little longer than 30 minutes but it's still a good way to have a quick dabble with AngularJs.
