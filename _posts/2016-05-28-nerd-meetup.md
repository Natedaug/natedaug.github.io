I finally got a chance to attend a local code [meetup](http://www.meetup.com/).  Actually 2 of them, [FullStack-Stl](http://www.meetup.com/FullStack-STL/) and [node.jSTL](http://www.meetup.com/node-jSTL/).  It was a good for me to get off my ass and see what other fellow nerds are doing in person.  I had to burn out early at the Full-Stack meetup, but I did get a chance to see a presentation on [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/).  I've been circling around React for a while now, I've done a little messing around with it on [CodePen](http://codepen.io/Natedaug/) but haven't gotten too deep with it yet.  I've been doing the same with Angular2, which is probably what I'll try and sink my teeth into further since I've got pretty aquainted with it's older brother Angular1.  No matter what frame-work you use, it seems the important thing to understand is the concept to break down UI into reusable components.

On to the node meet up.  A lot of stuff was there that I found particulary interesting. Beer. Free beer. Actually both meet ups had free beer.  I need to start going to more meet ups.  Anyways the first presentation was on the new changes in Javascript with ES6.  A lot of changes happened that I'm still not even aware of but it was usefull to see a real person show the ones that they found usefull.  I don't remember all that was covered but here are a few articles covering the topic: [5-great-features-in-es6-harmony](http://www.wintellect.com/devcenter/nstieglitz/5-great-features-in-es6-harmony) and an in depth one at [mozilla](https://hacks.mozilla.org/category/es6-in-depth/) and [ponyfoo.com](https://ponyfoo.com/) has some good articles on it, the site can be a bit difficult to navigate but the nerd who made it seems like he knows what hes talking about.

The second presentation was on [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).  It's a javascript library that accomplishes a lot of the same things that Angular and React do. Apparently it's easier to learn and implement.  It looks similar to Angular but you don't have to deal with all the configuration.  It looks like it could be a good tool to be aware of.

[Chris Schmitz](https://github.com/chris-schmitz/)'s github page.  Smart dude with a lot of examples.

The last presentation was on using [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/).  It seems pretty cool.  Gives you the ability to host a single function that can be accessed from anywhere.  Something I'll have to look in to.  The whole AWS sea of shit can be a bit daunting, but so is the whole DevOps world.

All right, this post got a bit long winded, but it's _been a while_ since I posted last.  I'll try to add a bunch of stuff here shortly.
