In pursuit of full stack web development I took a little spin with the [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) web framework.  I went through the Todo app [tutorial](https://www.meteor.com/tutorials/blaze/creating-an-app).  A short tutorial that shows off some cool features of Meteor.  The coolest part for me was you only used three files in the tutorial; HTML, CSS and JS.  With just three files you could make a fullstack application, that's pretty nuts.  _Any Billy can be a fullstack web developer with Meteor!_ That should be their slogan.
