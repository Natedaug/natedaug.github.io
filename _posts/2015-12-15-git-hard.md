For some reason I'm having trouble wrapping my head around working with git.  Of all things I've tried to use it has been the most frustrating and confusing.  It at least could take me out to dinner before it mind fucks me.  That said I just wanted to leave a link to a good stack overflow [answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15376241/why-does-git-say-my-master-branch-is-already-up-to-date-even-though-it-is-not) to the question _Why does Git say my master branch is “already up to date” even though it is not?_.
