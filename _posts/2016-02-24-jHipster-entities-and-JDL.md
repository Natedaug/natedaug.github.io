Here is a blog post I found helpful regarding jHipster(the mullet generator). It's called [JHipster Entities, JDL and how to regenerate](http://javedmandary.blogspot.com/2016/02/jhipster-entities-jdl-and-how-to.html) by (Javed Mandary)[https://plus.google.com/105059031980475886332/posts].  He talks about using jhipster-uml to generate his entities with ( JHipster Domain Language  (JDL)[http://jhipster.github.io/jhipster-uml/#jdl].  I've mainly used the command line tool to do it but I am finding it difficult when making more complex projects.  It's just good to see another blog post about jHipster, since it can be difficult to find resources for some one with little java or spring experience.
