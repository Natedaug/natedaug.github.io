I'm trying to get a handle on [git](https://git-scm.com/) and using it with [GitHub](https://github.com) lately.  I use GitHub to house most of my main projects I'm working on.  This site is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).  I actually haven't edited any code on this site _yet_.  It's been an expirement with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and GitHub pages.  I forked a Jekyll site on GitHub and edit through the browser with [prose.io](https://prose.io/). So far this site has never touched my computer locally.

Anyways git has been a little harder to remeber commands and use. I found a very nice looking site that reads easy at [Attlasion](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials).  For a more indepth look I found [git dudes](http://www.gitguys.com/) have pretty extensive guides to using git.
