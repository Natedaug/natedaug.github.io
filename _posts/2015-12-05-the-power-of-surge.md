When i discovered [Surge.sh](https://surge.sh/) it was a Web life changing event.  It allows you to publish static web sites incredibly easy, all you do is type `surge` in your terminal at the root directory of your site.  Yes it's that easy, and then your site is up on the web for all the world to masterbate to.  No messing with FTPs and searching for a host, and the best part is it's **100%** **FREE** and they aim to keep it that way.

This is what peaked my recent interest in making static sites.  Between [Surge](https://surge.sh/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) you have some legitimite free hosting for any static site.

Combine these with a static site generator and you have an incredible power to put out full fledge sites within minutes.  There are a ton static site generators to choose from, but I've been sticking with [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) because the community behind it is quite large.  But I'll kep an eye on the others, and I feel like the next truly great generator is on the horizon that will change things dramaticly.  If not it's already pretty sweet.
