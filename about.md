My core skills are with HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery and AngularJs.  I'm far from an expert on any of them but those were my base skills at the onset of this blog.  I'm trying to learn as much as possible and I created this blog as just a list of resources and links for me to track my learning and to circle back through.

I'm interested in learning static site generators and creating full stack web apps.  Wish me luck!
